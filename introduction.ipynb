        "The first step in interpretability is typically to understand the features a neuron is learning from. There would be no mystery if neurons corresponded to verifiable input features. For example, if a neuron fires on dog tails, or on Korean poetry. Since neural networks incorporate non-linearities, this is not always the case, and we will see how small a fraction of features we are able to extract in relation to the number of neurons in a network. This phenonemon is known as 'superposition'."
